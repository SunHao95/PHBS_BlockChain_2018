# Bitcoin Futures

## Basic Introduction of Bitcoin Futures
Bitcoin futures are futures contracts that speculate on the price of Bitcoin without participants actually having to own Bitcoin. Entities that participate in Bitcoin futures are essentially making a bet on the price of Bitcoin over a specified period. Bitcoin futures work the same way as any futures contract on a traditional financial asset. Investors can either go long on Bitcoin — expecting the price to increase — or short it, mitigating potential losses if they actually own some Bitcoin.

In December 2017 trading in futures contracts on Bitcoins commenced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange. On the December 1st, both exchanges announced a Bitcoin futures contract. Bitcoin futures opened for trading on the CBOE December 10th, 2017. This is one of the biggest milestones for bitcoin since it emerged in the wake of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. CBOE was soon joined by CME Group as it launched bitcoin futures contracts on December 18th, 2017.

For investors looking to speculate on the price of Bitcoin without having to actually own any directly, Bitcoin futures provide a viable, regulated means to do so effectively. Further, futures can help hedge against risk against the volatile price fluctuations of Bitcoin. Bitcoin futures will bring much-needed transparency, greater liquidity and efficient price discovery to the ecosystem.

Bitcoin futures provide several advantages for investors. First, they are traded on regulated exchanges, making the process much more familiar and comfortable for mainstream and institutional investors who may not want to deal directly with cryptocurrency exchanges. Second, the contracts allow for speculation on the underlying price of the asset without having to go through the process of properly storing bitcoins, which is a high barrier to entry for many people unfamiliar with how Bitcoin works. Third, by granting Bitcoin more exposure to investors, more liquidity is added to the market. Finally, futures trading can lead to less volatility of Bitcoin’s price in the long-term and enable investors to protect themselves from adverse price swings.


## Platforms Offering Bitcoin Futures Trading
CBOE launched the first Bitcoin futures in December 2017, followed by another Chicago-based platform, CME. Since then, several platforms and major institutions have signaled their plans to launch Bitcoin futures, including some cryptocurrency exchanges. Some of the major platforms where Bitcoin futures can be traded include:

* CBOE – One of the largest futures exchanges in the world. First to launch Bitcoin futures trading.
* Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group (CME) – Chicago-based derivatives and futures trading exchange. Announced that Bitcoin futures trading grew 119 percent throughout 2018 on their platform.
* BitMEX – One of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Offers Bitcoin futures trading (not available to U.S. citizens).
* TD Ameritrade – One of the largest brokerage firms in the world. 
* OKEx – Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency trading platform offering Bitcoin futures — not available to U.S. citizens.
* Nasdaq – Second largest stock market exchange (by market cap) in the world. Launched Bitcoin futures trading in early 2019.
* Bakkt – Upcoming Bitcoin futures trading and custody platform backed by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) which owns the NYSE. Have delayed the launch several times, but offered physical delivery of Bitcoin for futures contracts in early 2019 and provided custodial services for investors.


## The Influence of Bitcoin Futures on Bitcoins
### Basic idea
From Bitcoin’s inception in 2009 through mid-2017, its price remained under $4,000. In the second half of 2017, it climbed dramatically to nearly $20,000, but descended rapidly starting in mid-December. The peak price coincided with the introduction of bitcoin futures trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The rapid run-up and subsequent fall in the price after the introduction of futures does not appear to be a coincidence. Rather, it is consistent with trading behavior that typically accompanies the introduction of futures markets for an asset.

</br>
Figure 1 shows the three largest bitcoin price declines in 2017. We scale the three series so that the peak values are equal to 100 on the peak event days. Hence, each point on the figure can be interpreted as a percent of the peak value. The horizontal axis represents the number of days before and after the peak dates. The price decline following the issuance of bitcoin futures on the CME (red line) is clearly larger than in the previous two reversals. Additionally, the two earlier decreases in prices returned to pre-crash levels in about a month. As of late April, the bitcoin price had not returned to its pre-futures peak. We can preliminarily infer that the introduction of Bitcoin futures may cast a certain influence on bitcoin price. And this is not the first time that markets observed a turning point following the introduction of a new instrument, as Fostel and Geanakoplos (2012) show for the more complex mortgage-backed securities market.</br>

In the following part, I will mainly refer to *Shan, Brain, Maurice and Samuel's* paper "Bitcoin Futures—What use are they" to help illustrate the influence of Bitcoin Futures on Bitcoin. And try to answer three main questions:</br>
__1. Will spot volatility be reduced after the introduction of Bitcoin Futures?__</br>
__2. Are Bitcoin Futures effective hedging tools?__</br>
__3. Can Bitcoin perform its function of price discovery?__</br>

## Emprical Analysis
### Statistical View of Data        
As it shows in the table, we can conclude that Bitcoin's return and Ether's return are left-skewed with negative skewness. On the contratry, Litecoin's return has the right-skewed distribution. All of them own the heavy-tailed distributions. <br>
