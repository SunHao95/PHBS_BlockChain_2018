# Bitcoin Futures

## Basic Introduction of Bitcoin Futures
Bitcoin futures are futures contracts that speculate on the price of Bitcoin without participants actually having to own Bitcoin. Entities that participate in Bitcoin futures are essentially making a bet on the price of Bitcoin over a specified period. Bitcoin futures work the same way as any futures contract on a traditional financial asset. Investors can either go long on Bitcoin — expecting the price to increase — or short it, mitigating potential losses if they actually own some Bitcoin.

In December 2017 trading in futures contracts on Bitcoins commenced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange. On the December 1st, both exchanges announced a Bitcoin futures contract. Bitcoin futures opened for trading on the CBOE December 10th, 2017. This is one of the biggest milestones for bitcoin since it emerged in the wake of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. CBOE was soon joined by CME Group as it launched bitcoin futures contracts on December 18th, 2017.</br>

For investors looking to speculate on the price of Bitcoin without having to actually own any directly, Bitcoin futures provide a viable, regulated means to do so effectively. Further, futures can help hedge against risk against the volatile price fluctuations of Bitcoin. Bitcoin futures will bring much-needed transparency, greater liquidity and efficient price discovery to the ecosystem.

Bitcoin futures provide several advantages for investors. First, they are traded on regulated exchanges, making the process much more familiar and comfortable for mainstream and institutional investors who may not want to deal directly with cryptocurrency exchanges. Second, the contracts allow for speculation on the underlying price of the asset without having to go through the process of properly storing bitcoins, which is a high barrier to entry for many people unfamiliar with how Bitcoin works. Third, by granting Bitcoin more exposure to investors, more liquidity is added to the market. Finally, futures trading can lead to less volatility of Bitcoin’s price in the long-term and enable investors to protect themselves from adverse price swings.


## Platforms Offering Bitcoin Futures Trading
CBOE launched the first Bitcoin futures in December 2017, followed by another Chicago-based platform, CME. Since then, several platforms and major institutions have signaled their plans to launch Bitcoin futures, including some cryptocurrency exchanges. Some of the major platforms where Bitcoin futures can be traded include:

* CBOE – One of the largest futures exchanges in the world. First to launch Bitcoin futures trading.
* Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group (CME) – Chicago-based derivatives and futures trading exchange. Announced that Bitcoin futures trading grew 119 percent throughout 2018 on their platform.
* BitMEX – One of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Offers Bitcoin futures trading (not available to U.S. citizens).
* TD Ameritrade – One of the largest brokerage firms in the world. 
* OKEx – Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency trading platform offering Bitcoin futures — not available to U.S. citizens.
* Nasdaq – Second largest stock market exchange (by market cap) in the world. Launched Bitcoin futures trading in early 2019.
* Bakkt – Upcoming Bitcoin futures trading and custody platform backed by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) which owns the NYSE. Have delayed the launch several times, but offered physical delivery of Bitcoin for futures contracts in early 2019 and provided custodial services for investors.


## The Influence of Bitcoin Futures on Bitcoins
### Basic idea
From Bitcoin’s inception in 2009 through mid-2017, its price remained under $4,000. In the second half of 2017, it climbed dramatically to nearly $20,000, but descended rapidly starting in mid-December. The peak price coincided with the introduction of bitcoin futures trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The rapid run-up and subsequent fall in the price after the introduction of futures does not appear to be a coincidence. Rather, it is consistent with trading behavior that typically accompanies the introduction of futures markets for an asset.

</br>
Figure 1 shows the three largest bitcoin price declines in 2017. We scale the three series so that the peak values are equal to 100 on the peak event days. Hence, each point on the figure can be interpreted as a percent of the peak value. The horizontal axis represents the number of days before and after the peak dates. The price decline following the issuance of bitcoin futures on the CME (red line) is clearly larger than in the previous two reversals. Additionally, the two earlier decreases in prices returned to pre-crash levels in about a month. As of late April, the bitcoin price had not returned to its pre-futures peak. We can preliminarily infer that the introduction of Bitcoin futures may cast a certain influence on bitcoin price. And this is not the first time that markets observed a turning point following the introduction of a new instrument, as Fostel and Geanakoplos (2012) show for the more complex mortgage-backed securities market.</br>
</br>

In the following part, I will mainly refer to *Shan, Brain, Maurice and Samuel's* paper "Bitcoin Futures—What use are they" to help illustrate the influence of Bitcoin Futures on Bitcoin. And try to answer three main questions:</br>
__1. Will spot volatility be reduced after the introduction of Bitcoin Futures?__</br>
__2. Are Bitcoin Futures effective hedging tools?__</br>
__3. Can Bitcoin perform its function of price discovery?__</br>

The data is sampled at a one-minute frequency. The characteristics of Bitcoin data covering the period from the 26st of September 2017 to the 22nd of February 2018 can be found in Table 2. Statistics for the full period and for sub-samples before and after the introduction of futures trading are also presented.</br>
Since the introduction of futures, the distribution characteristics of Bitcoin returns have changed significantly. The symbol of mean changes, and the standard deviation doubles.

### Emprical Analysis
#### Spot Volatility Analysis
<div align=center><img width="800" height="800"           src="https://github.com/SunHao95/PHBS_BlockChain_2018/blob/master/images/Figure%202.png"/></div><div align=center> Figure 2. Change point detection </div>

The author applied Mood statistic for changes in volatility (scale) and a Lepage-(type) statistic ( *Ross et al.* (2011) and *Ross et al.* (2015)) which tests for changes in location and scale, the results of which are presented in Figure 2. Figure 2 presents the Raw Returns Mood Statistics (Top Panel) and GARCH(1,1) Residuals Mood Statistic (Bottom Panel) respectively. The implementation of these statistics for change point detection was executed relying on the cpm package in R and is used to establish the existence and location of a change point in the Bitcoin price series. Both the Mood and Lepage statistics indicate there is a significant change in the distribution, driven by the increase in volatility.The date of the change is the 29th of November 2017, two days before the official announcement of the commencement dates for futures trading. Therefore, different from the general understanding that after the introduction of futures, the volatility of spot prices will be reduced. The introduction of Bitcoin futures actually increases the volatility of the Bitcoin.

#### Hedging Effectiveness Analysis
Table 3. Descriptive statistics for bitcoin prices and returns

|__Naive Hedge__||
|:------|------|
|Risk Reduction| −334.59|
|Hedge Effectiveness| −3.3459|
|Hedge Effectiveness| (semivariance) −1.20851|
|__Rolling OLS Hedge__||
|Risk Reduction| −60.7627|
|Hedge Effectiveness| −0.60763|
|Hedge Effectiveness| (semivariance) −0.38919|

Two hedging approaches are evaluated by the aurthor. The first is the naïve hedge which is a portfolio with one short futures position for every Bitcoin position, while the second approach is the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) hedge. The semi-variance is also adopted, which measures the variability of returns below the mean, addressing a shortcoming of the variance and providing a more intuitive measure of risk for hedging focused on downside risk.</br>
</br>
As is indicated by the negative sign of the effectiveness and risk reduction results, the hedging operation in fact surprisingly increases the risk, though the OLS hedging is more effective than the naive hedging.


#### Price Discovery Analysis
Table 4. Price discovery results

|Information Share (Hasbruck)| Lower Bound |Upper Bound |Average|
|:------:|------|------|------|
|Futures| 0.115535| 0.183738| 0.149637|
|Bitcoin| 0.816261| 0.884465|0.850363|
|__Component Share (Gonzalo)__|__Average__| | |
|Futures| 0.177028| | |
|Bitcoin| 0.822971| | |
|__Information Leadership (Yan)__|__Average__| | |
|Futures| 0.025636| | |
|Bitcoin| 0.827931| | |
|__Information Leadership Share (Putnins)__|__Average__| | |
|Futures|0.030034| | |
|Bitcoin| 0.969965| | |

There are two standard measures of price discovery commonly employed in the literature: the Hasbrouck (1995) Information Share (IS) and the Gonzalo and Granger (1995) Component Share (CS) measure. IS and CS, as developed by Hauptfleisch et al. (2016) using the error correction parameters and variance–covariance of the error terms from the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM)
